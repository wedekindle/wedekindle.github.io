I'm a second-year doctoral (DPhil Biomedical Sciences) student interested in harnessing methods in genetic epidemiology and statistical genetics to understand how genetic and environmental factors are associated with diabetes and birth weight, across diverse populations. Supported by the NIH-Oxford-Cambridge Scholars Program, I study between the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Diabetes and Kidney Diseases (NIH/NIDDK Phoenix) and the University of Oxford's Nuffield Department of Medicine.

Working at the interface of genetics and epidemiology, I also actively seek opportunities to engage with the broader science community and public through science communication and regarding biomedical ethics. Before beginning my DPhil studies, I completed an Intramural Research Traineeship in diabetes and genetics at the NIH/NIDDK Phoenix, MSc in Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and BA in Human Biology at Stanford University. Ultimately, I intend to continue researching diabetes and promoting diversity and inclusion among students pursuing health professions as a clinician-researcher.
